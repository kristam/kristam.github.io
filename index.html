		<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>I am a Regional Business Development Manager, living in New York NY. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because well, I’ve always been interested!  I currently work for a digital marketing agency and am looking to get out of my sales role and into a more hands-on role.  I’ve noticed a lot of marketing roles require/prefer HTML knowledge so I thought this would be a great class to take. </p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>
