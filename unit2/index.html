	<title> Unit 2: Lamington Drive vs. Fieldwork</title>

		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/">Lamington Drive</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://madebyfieldwork.com/">Fieldwork</a></li>
			</ul>


		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			<p>Lamington Drive uses space well.  The large background image over laid with white text that is minimal draws your eyes to the main parts of the page.  The logo, and navigation in the upper right hand corner.  The site also drives the need to scroll with minimal information above the fold.  Fieldwork uses balance well.  Love this page!  The balance of the moving objects with stationary objects doesn't hold your eye too long, and ultimately drives you back to the text in the middle right of the page.  I'm still prompted to scroll, but it's a great main page.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>Both sites appeal to me because of their simplicity.  Nothing bothers me more than going to a website where I can't get the information I need right away, i.e. what do you do and how can I learn more...f course depending on the business.   I like the use of open space and balance between positive space and negative space.  The two are different in their ability to move the users eye and proving information.  Lamington Drive takes a few scrolls or clicks for me to figure out what they are offering.  Fieldwork on the other hand could use a tweak to the layout of the text and the moving images to make it clear to the user what this company does.</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Fieldwork Sketch #1</strong></li>
					<img src="Fieldwork1.jpg">
						<p>For the first thumbnail sketch I wanted to keep it similar to the origional page, but just change the positioning of the text.  I want it to be larger and in the upper left hand corner, not too far from the origional placement.  Instead of getting distracted by the moving images below.  I think this helps create better balance in the page.  Same with moving the navigation to the left, so it can be clearly seen. </p>
				<li><strong>Fieldwork Sketch #2</strong></li>
					<img src="Fieldwork2.jpg">
						<p>In this sketch I wanted to use the animation, since it's clearly the focal point of the page, to imbed the navigation.  In my mind after clicking it falls down to the next page where that section is location.  Also adding bigger test to create balance on the page and clear understanding of what the page is about.</p>
				<li><strong>Lamington Drive Sketch #1</strong></li>
					<img src="Lamington1.jpg">
						<p>The biggest issue for me on this page is the navigation, I felt like I had to look at every corner of the page to undersatnd what it was about.  So I moved the navigation to the left and aligned it with the logo and text, which the sub-navitions below to keep balance on the page.</p>
				<li><strong>Lamington Drive Sketch #2</strong></li>
					<img src="Lamington2.jpg">
						<p>The second sketch for this site is probably my favorite because of the flow of the page.  I wanted to ad text with more information about the company/page and then to follow to their openings, as that is most likely what the user is looking for.  I think that and the placement of social media thumbnails on the top left balance that page well.</p>
